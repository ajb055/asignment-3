      <h2 class="text-center">DOSA</h2>
         <p>A dosa is a rice pancake, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a common part of the diet in South India, but has become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar and chutney.</p>
       

        <p>Which rice and dal to use: for this recipe I use a combination of idli rice and sona masoori rice. You can use only sona masoori rice or idli rice too. The combination helps in making the dosa crispier I feel.The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 3:1 or 4:1. The batter is allowed to ferment overnight, before being mixed with water to get the desired consistency. The batter is then ladled onto a hot tava (griddle) greased with oil or ghee (clarified butter). It is spread out with the base of a ladle or bowl to form a pancake. It can be made either to be thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy..</p>

         <p>Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars or saturated fats. As its key ingredients are rice and black gram, it is also a good source of protein.[10] One home made plain dosa without oil contains about 112 calories, of which 84% is carbohydrate and 16% protein.[11] The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content.[12] There are instant mix products for making dosa which usually contain higher levels of rice.</p>

         <p>The most popular version is the masala dosa, with a filling of the potato masala. Mysore masala is the spicier version of it. Sada (plain) is without filling; paper dosa is a thin and crisp version. Rava dosa is made crispier using semolina.[14] Newer recipes have been developed that use fusion, like Chinese dosa, cheese dosa, paneer dosa and many more.[15]

         Though dosa typically refers to the version made with rice and lentils, many other versions exist.Rava dosa is made crispier using semolina.[14] Newer recipes have been developed that use fusion, like Chinese dosa, cheese dosa, paneer dosa and many more.</p>

      <h3 class="text-center">PIZZA</h3>
         <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.) which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>

         <p>In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>

       <p>  The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery.[5][6] Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.</p>
